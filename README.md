Inspired by the many excellent lorem ipsum generators, this simple webapp generates placeholder text. However, instead of generating plain text, this generator gives you structured text in the form of markdown. In order to do so, it uses Markov Chains and many heuristics. It was written in Haskell and the source code is available on GitHub. Crafted with a lot of love for the markdown format by Jasper Van der Jeugt. An HTTP API is also available!
